# Melanoma Detection
> This project is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. The aim is to build a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma and reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This project builds Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification.
- This project uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11.3
- Pandas - version 1.5.3
- Numpy - version 1.24.3
- tensorflow - version 2.18.0
- keras - version 3.6.0
- Jupyter Notebook - version 6.5.4

## Conclusions
- There is a major class imbalance in the dataset.
- Handling the class imbalance has resulted in signficant improvement in the accuracy of the model.
